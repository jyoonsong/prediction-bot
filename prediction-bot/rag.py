Carefully read the articles provided above. Your task is to generate a multi-paragraph summary (one paragraph per article) that highlights factual insights or relevant context related to the listed markets. Avoid subjective opinions or speculative statements. Use plain text without markdown syntax, heading, or numbering. Do not add any additional text outside the summary.
Return blank for an article that does not contain relevant information. Not all of the articles are relevant to the markets above. Some are clearly unrelated to the topic and should be excluded. Exclude only the articles that are clearly off-topic, entirely unrelated to the markets. If an article is at least broadly related or offers potentially useful context, it should be considered relevant.
Important note: Include the date and source URL of the article at the end of each paragraph.
